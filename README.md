# Homework-two
This 2nd Homework is mainly used with the bootstrap application with a little normal css use. For the navbar, I used the bootstrap navbar with the about me, contact, and portfilio tab that will go to each one. I also positoned the tabs to the right. For the about me page, I used the row and column system to position the picture and the text. For the contact page, I used the row and column system again but also implimented a text area for the comment and a button for the submit. For the portfilio page I used containers and colums to position my pictures. I also used most of my css that when hovering over a certain picture it will animate and show the description.

Note* This was challenging for me to impliment and even after the week I am still not satified with the final results. That being said I will continue to work on this page while still getting more familar with bootstrap. Also ignore the test file.
