# Homework-two
Here is the updated version of my online portfolio. I added an extra tab called "links" on the navbar where it shows my resume, github and linkedin which are also updated. My contact page shows my phone number and my email. My portfolio shows my project and all the HW i've done.(im still deciding on what homework I would like to show in time.) If you click on the image it will show the deployed version. If you click on the repo button it will show the url to the repo.
